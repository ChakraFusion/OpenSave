// Two devices meeting with no agreed state yet, both holding a save, are
// asked which to keep: nothing says which is newer. Unless one of them has
// held the other's save before. A device joining with an old copy — from a
// backup, an earlier install, a folder copied across — holds a state the
// other device has in its own history, and then there is nothing to ask: a
// state both have held is a merge base by definition, the same proof the push
// and served records give (served.go). Banked, the sync judges the two
// against it as always, and the old copy is simply behind.
//
// Each side can only look in its own history. The device holding the newer
// save finds the peer's state there on its own sync; the device holding the
// old copy asks the peer, on a second manifest request identifying
// its own files (ManifestQuery.Held, heldKey), and the peer answers HeldYours. Usually
// the old copy's device syncs first: tracking the game is what starts it.
//
// Compared on files alone, as snapshots record them, after each side's own
// exclusion rules: two devices with different rules simply find no match, and
// are asked as before. So is a peer that predates the question.

// heldKey identifies a save by its files alone, as a snapshot records them:
// how many there are, then a hash of their paths and content hashes, no
// folders. The count goes first so that the device asked can pass over every
// snapshot that holds fewer files without reading it.
