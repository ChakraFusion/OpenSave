// sync the file still differs on both sides, so Compute falls to its
// mtime tiebreak — and if the peer's copy happens to carry a newer mtime,
// OUR version would be pulled away, silently undoing the user's "keep
// mine" choice. So we refresh our save files' mtimes to now: the content

// unambiguously the newest, so the sync direction is a push. The peer
// then receives our version (its own engine snapshots first, or re-raises
// its own conflict if it has newer unsynced work of its own).
//
// The lineage, though, must say only what both sides verifiably hold. It used
// to record every local file as shared (persistLineage(local, local)) before
// the peer had pulled any of it. When that pull did not finish — a large save,
// a request that timed out, a device that went away — the next sync found
// those files "shared before and missing on the peer now", read that as the
// peer having deleted them, and deleted them HERE: on the device whose version
// the person had just chosen to keep. A save of a quarter-million files lost
// tens of thousands that way, and the folders differing again re-raised the
// conflict, inviting the same answer. Now the record is the intersection of
// the two saves as they stand; a file only this device has is new to the
// peer, not deleted by it, and goes over on the next sync. If the peer cannot
// be asked, nothing is recorded as shared, so nothing can be read as deleted.
