// quickInSync settles the common case of a sync in one small exchange: this
// device's save still hashes to the base both devices last agreed on, and
// the peer, asked whether it does too (ManifestQuery.IfHash), says
// "unchanged". Then there is nothing to decide, and neither manifest needs
// to cross the wire — for a save of a quarter-million files that is tens of
// MB of JSON per peer, which the minute-long reconcile used to fetch every
// minute to learn that nothing had changed.
//
// It only ever answers "in sync" when both sides provably hold the agreed
// state. In every other case it reports not done and the full sync runs; a
// full manifest that came back anyway (a peer that predates the question)
// is handed over in prefetched so it is not fetched twice.
//
// Deliberately narrow:
//   - no exclusion rules: the agreed base is taken over the filtered
//     manifest, the peer hashes its unfiltered one;
//   - no extra save locations: those carry bases of their own (RootHash);
//   - no conflict waiting, and the same branch on both sides.
