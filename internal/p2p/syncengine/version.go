// Save versions.
//
// Every device knows which version of a game's save it holds, as a version
// vector: one counter per device that has ever changed the save, moved only
// when the save really changes there (the watcher saw the game or the user
// write it — never a sync). Comparing two vectors answers, exactly, the
// question the file-by-file comparison could only guess at from what each side
// happens to hold:
//
//   - one is older than the other: that device is simply behind. It takes the
//     newer save as a whole — every file, and every deletion — and only from a
//     device that holds it completely. Nothing is ever taken from it, pushed
//     by it, or deleted on its say-so, and it is a source for nobody.
//   - equal: the same save.
//   - neither: both changed it independently. Only then is anyone asked.
//
// A device also remembers the newest version it has heard of (the target)
// until it holds it. That is what keeps two outdated devices from syncing with
// each other: each knows something newer exists, so each waits for a device
// that holds it, instead of reading the other's half-finished copy as the save
// and passing on what it lacks as deletions.
//
// An empty folder holds no version at all, which is older than every version,
// so a new or emptied device fills itself from a complete one and never raises
// a conflict. A save that existed before this was introduced gets a version
// named after its content (genesisKey), so devices that already held the same
// save agree at once, and ones that did not are compared the way they always
// were, until they agree.
